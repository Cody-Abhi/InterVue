## 📌 Overview  
InterVue is an AI-powered interview simulation platform designed to help students and job seekers prepare for real-world interviews in a realistic, interactive, and adaptive manner. The platform simulates technical, behavioral, and HR interviews using intelligent questioning, real-time feedback, and performance analytics.

The core problem InterVue addresses is the lack of accessible, realistic interview practice for candidates—especially students—leading to low confidence, poor communication skills, and inadequate interview readiness.
